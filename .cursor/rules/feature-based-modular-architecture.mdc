Use feature based modular architecture with atomic design principlesa and shared layers.
Each feature folder should contains everything that belongs to that feature:
e.g.

- src/

  - features/
    - gates/
      - api.ts // /gates, /gates/{code}
      - types.ts
      - hooks.ts // useGates, useGateDetails
      - screens/
        - GatesListScreen.tsx
        - GateDetailsScreen.tsx
      - components/
        - GateList.tsx // organism (composed of shared atoms/molecules)
        - GateLinksList.tsx // organism
    - routes/
    - transport/
    - journeyMemory/
  - shared/

    - components/

      - atoms/
      - molecules/
      - organisms/
      - template

    - hooks/
    - utils/
    - theme/
